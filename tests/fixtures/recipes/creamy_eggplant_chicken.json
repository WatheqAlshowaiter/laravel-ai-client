I love the combination of the savoury eggplant, the sweet onion, and the tanginess of the Greek yoghurt. The result is an incredibly tasty and hearty main dish.\n\nTo create this recipe, I started off by cutting chicken into cubes and then marinating them in a mixture of yogurt, garlic, and spices. This adds tremendous flavour to the chicken and helps tenderize the meat. Next, I chopped an onion and saut\u00e9ed it in a pan with a bit of oil until it began to brown. Then I added in the eggplant cubes and cooked it all together until the vegetables were soft and beginning to caramelize. Finally, I added the marinated chicken and cooked it until it was cooked through.\n\nTo finish off the dish, I added Greek yoghurt, which adds a lovely creaminess. This is optional, but I highly recommend it. Once everything was cooked through, I served the creamy eggplant chicken with some fresh parsley, for a bit of colour.\n\nNutritional Information Per Serving:\n\nCalories: 250\n\nFat: 5g\n\nCarbs: 15g\n\nProtein: 25g\n\nThis is a great way to add some quick, healthy protein to your dinner table.
